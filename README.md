# Signal-Pre-Processing
Some basic techniques to pre-process signals for data extraction.

1.Sine_Function.m:
Here I demonstrate how to generate a sinosoid of a given frequency and time period. It's subsequent harmonics are plotted after intoducing a non-linearity.

2.Fitting the Bell Curve.m
Some code to fit a bell curve on normally distributed data ( mean ~ 0, sigma ~ 1). Also, a way to generate random normally distributed data and represent it using a histogram.
